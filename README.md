What is this app?

A web application built with React in the frontend,
Java as the backend, connected to an MYSQL database.
Allows users to create 'chats/rooms/!!groups!!',
can invite users to the group. For each meal / day users can creat a poll
that they can vote on "What to have for dinner?", "What to have for lunch?" etc

Fun minigames as deciders??? (Snake, tetris, pictionary??? etc?)
